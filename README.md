# Rango
My first Django Project.
This project is an implementation of the Rango app in TangoWithDjango book.
Rango is a webpage directory which stores various categories and pages within those categories along with views and likes related to that particular page/category. The homepage displays top 5 pages and top 5 categories.
Users can register and log in. Logging in allows users to add categories/pages.
